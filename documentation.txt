AWS Services Involved
-> VPC
A dedicated network where all resources live.

-> Subnets
Public subnets -> For ALB
Private subnets -> For EKS nodes, pods, databases (future use)

-> Internet Gateway
Allows inbound/outbound internet traffic for public subnets.

-> NAT Gateway
Allows private instances to reach the internet (e.g., container image pulls).

-> Route Tables
Defines how subnets communicate with the internet or private components.

-> Security Groups
Firewall rules for:
ALB
EKS Cluster
Worker Nodes

-> EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
Managed Kubernetes control plane + worker nodes.

-> ALB (Application Load Balancer)
Routes traffic from users -> cluster services.

-> Terraform Overview (How We Build Infrastructure)
Terraform is used to automate the provisioning of all AWS resources.

Key Terraform Concepts

main.tf -> Defines all resources
variables.tf -> Accepts input parameters
outputs.tf -> Displays useful information
.tfstate -> Stores resource tracking info

-> Terraform Workflow
Initialize : terraform init
Validate : terraform validate
Plan : terraform plan
Apply : terraform apply -auto-approve
Destroy (with caution!) : terraform destroy -auto-approve


-> After applying, Terraform creates:

VPC
Subnets
NAT Gateway
Route tables
EKS cluster
Managed node group
ALB
Everything is automated.

-> EKS Basics 
EKS = Kubernetes running on AWS

It includes:

Control Plane (AWS-managed)
API Server
etcd
Scheduler
Controllers

We do not manage these directly.

-> Worker Nodes (EC2 instances)

Managed node group
Lives in private subnets
Runs pods using container runtime

-> Kubernetes Objects You Should Know

Pods -> Smallest compute unit
Deployments -> Manages pods and updates
Services -> Internal/external communication
Ingress -> Route traffic via ALB
ConfigMaps -> App configuration
Secrets -> Secure values

-> Traffic Flow Explanation (Very Important)

        User -> Public ALB -> Kubernetes Ingress -> Service -> Pod
